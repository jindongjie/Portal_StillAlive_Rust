### Portal_Still_Alive_Rust
 - this TUI program is for recreate *final sence* (a Command-line User Interface or T-UI) of [Portal: Still Alive](https://theportalwiki.com).
 - single excutable program compile and by github CI Very simply to use and secure.
 - compability for main-stream terminal (powershell/kitty/gnomeshell/etc).
 - Even compability with old REAL TTY dumb terminal (VT100,VT220/etc).

## Hardware support
depending sound output capability, until now, the project will support Linux,Window,MacOS for variant of CPU architecture.
You can manually compile it to any OS if Rust ProgramingLangurage support, and need advanced rust knowladge to deal with dependency and compile error ;)

## Idea
 - This program inspire by project[Portal_Still_Alive_Python](https://github.com/errorer/Portal_StillAlive_Python), but python envoriment is not easy to setup and don't give good compability, so i create this program.
